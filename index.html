            I've been a bit behind on my work lately, it may be because I can't get over the fact that Spring break was only 1 week. Regardless, I have a quiz for CSE 101 that I need to first watch the most recent lecture on before I can take that. Here is a list of the classes I have to watch lectures in:

            <li>CSE 130</li>
            <li>CSE 101</li>
            <br>

            After I finish watching those lectures, I need to start the homework for CSE 130. So far this quarter has been <b><em>very</em></b> stressful.

            Todays the day I had a quiz for CSE 101! To start the day of studying, I tried out the practice quiz, which to my surprise was very challenging. This made me study even harder to get ready for the real thing. I had to take it before midnight tonight and it is a timed 1 hr long test. After I want to play my favorite video game
